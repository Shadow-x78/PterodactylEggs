## 🔨 Configuration

The server will remain in the "Starting" state until the egg's `Start Configuration` is modified.  
You need to update the configuration to match the output printed by your application so that the Pterodactyl panel detects it as running.

For example, set it to:  
`Application is online`  
or  
`Server started successfully`.

Make sure the configuration reflects the exact output of your application.
